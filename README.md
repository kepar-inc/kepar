Executive Summary

Kepar is building America’s largest trade service company.
We combine AI service matching with exceptional service delivery to simplify the lives of homeowners, tenants and businesses in the U.S.
What We Do
Kepar is an AI-powered platform that enables anyone to control their homes and spaces—plumbing, electrical, cleaning, and lawn care—executed by top-tier, fully vetted local providers. Key functions:
Image to service booking
Tenant management
Asset management
Acquire established service-based businesses
Why It Matters (internal)
Kepar introduces clarity, speed, and user friendliness to customers—powered by advanced machine learning and software. And unlike gig apps, we own the full service experience.
Milestones
Launch WebApp
Acquire business with net  
Sub-15 min provider confirmations in live zones
Automated onboarding pipelines
LTV/CAC ratio exceeding 5:1
Products
Vision
Kepar will become the dominant infrastructure layer for trade service delivery in the U.S.—starting with trade services, then expanding into smart products, home warranties, and building. We’re building a system of trust, logistics, and learning at national scale.
Why Now
AI-native infrastructure enables vertical platforms like Kepar to automate legacy service models faster and accessible than ever before. Parallelly, established trade businesses are closing due to an aging population and no continuation. 
What Kepar is not:
It’s not TaskRabbit (too gig-economy).
It’s not Angie’s List or HomeAdvisor (too bloated and outdated).
It’s not Thumbtack (too inconsistent).

Small Business Focus

Acquire and operate established service-based businesses from tired owners. We offer a seamless transition that preserves the original business’s legacy, team, and customer relationships, while providing the former owner with lifetime profit-sharing, retirement planning, and peace of mind. Our mission is to continue delivering trusted local services, building a national network that customers turn to for everything from home maintenance to professional services — just as they rely on major retailers for goods. Kepar is creating the future of service delivery: personalized, reliable, and accessible from one trusted platform.
